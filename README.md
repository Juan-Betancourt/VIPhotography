## Overview

This application provides the accessibility, functionability, and simplicity to the user to view and download their photos. Futhermore, this webapp provides the photographer the ability to upload photos specifically to the client with their unique username and pin. The reason for this site is to provide the client and user a communication access and save their memories forever.

## Getting Started
The user must utilize the languages of HTML for the wireframe, CSS for the colors and layout. Additionally, the use of JavaScript is essential to provide the functionality of the webapp. However, the library of jQuery will reduce the code and avoide redundancy. Build a database with SQL to ADD, DELETE, and search WHERE specific names or categories are available to the webapp.
